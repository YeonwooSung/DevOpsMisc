# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

PostgreSQL features transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.

It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users.
It was the default database for macOS Server and is also available for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Windows.
